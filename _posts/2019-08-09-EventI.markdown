## [Zach Zheng, Jacobs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachitect/) <br> Visualised Betweenness
The project was designed for urban design quality assessment and explore the opportunities of refine design outcome both actively and passively. It is a workflow linking design principles and design outcome, involving data-rich BIM modelling, property estimation, connectivity, walkability, financial modelling, and urban impacts. It also reveals interesting differences between intuitive design outcome and results via computational design.

*Zach is an Architectural designer with strong focus on technology and their application in projects, actively seeking design quality improvement and team workflow optimisation from an interdisciplinary approach. The key pursuit is to produce evidence-based and scientifically-justifiable design solutions with great efficiency. Zach has 2 professional degrees in Architecture, specialises in Computational Design and Digital Engineering Solution.*

## [Dr Mehrnoush Latifi Khorasgani, Swinburne UT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehrnoush-latifi-45792554/) <br> Smart Skins for Smarter Cities
Mehrnoush is a lecturer of Design(Architecture) program in the Faculty of Health, Art and Design (FHAD) at Swinburne University of Technology. She is a research practitioner with extensive local and international industry experience in architecture field. She taught design studios at Melbourne School of Design, RMIT University (for Master of Design, Innovation and technology) and Swinburne University of Technology. Through both teaching and practice her research has focused around design with and for microclimates. She has been exploring how design language of geometry, color and material can form delightful microclimates and manipulate the sense of spaces.

*Her creative practice, research and teaching span the fields of Architecture, Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR and AR), Thermal Comfort, Microclimate Design and Digital Fabrication. Her creative projects have been exhibited in various exhibitions such as Embracing innovation Craft ACT 2015, Craft ACT 2016 Canberra, Dynamics of Air 2018 in Melbourne.*
