It is relatively brand new in its ability to write IFC files, but Blender has been able to read IFC files for a while now, also part of IfcOpenShell. It is still under heavy development, so it is not expected for use by end-users yet, but for those who are willing to give it a shot, it already has many interesting features, such as:

- Supports writing IFC4 files first and foremost.
- Lots of clever reuse of representations to create efficient and small IFC files.
- Supports the spatial tree including multiple buildings, multiple sites, and so on.
- Create project libraries, not just projects.
- Quantity take-off calculations.
- Property sets.
