Getting started developing on Hypar

From [https://hypar-io.github.io/Elements/](https://hypar-io.github.io/Elements/)

Hypar is a cloud platform for generating buildings that makes it easy to publish, distribute, and maintain your building design logic. Rather than requiring web development skills to scale and deliver your design logic, Hypar lets you concentrate on what you want to get done while the platform creates the interface for your audience and provides computation, visualization, delivery, interoperability, and access control for your functions.
