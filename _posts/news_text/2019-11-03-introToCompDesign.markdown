## GSD-6338: Introduction to Computational Design | Harvard GSD

"This is an introductory course to computational design. This course is primarily intended for designers with little background in programming who are interested in developing their skills in order to be able to better understand, interface with, and customize the digital tools they are using, or develop their own software and interactive applications. The course introduces students to fundamental concepts and techniques in computational design as well as the relevant mathematics. By the term “computational design” we mean an ad hoc set of methods borrowed from computer science, computational geometry, and other fields, and adapted to specific design problems such as design development, fabrication, analysis, interaction, and communication".
