New Book by McNeel: Essential Algorithms and Data Structures for Grasshopper

This new publication by McNeel introduces effective methodologies to develop complex 3D modeling algorithms using Grasshopper. It also covers extensively the data structure adopted by Grasshopper and its core organization and management tools. The material is directed towards designers who are interested in parametric design and have little or no background in programming.
