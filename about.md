We are a group of people passionate about Computational Design in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. 

We're going to have two or three 20-minute presentations about computational methodologies for a better built environment. 

There will also be industry updates, one-on-one QA sessions with the speakers and opportunities for casual networking + pizzas and drinks. 

This group is co-founded by [Giovanni Brogiolo](https://github.com/giobel){:target="_blank"} & [Hoss Zamani](https://github.com/HossZamani){:target="_blank"}. If you're passionate about computational design and willing to join this group please get in touch at [ComputationalAECMel@gmail.com](computationalaecmel@gmail.com)
