We are a group of people passionate about Computational Design in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. 

We're going to have two or three 20-minute presentations about computational methodologies for a better built environment. 

There will also be industry updates, one-on-one QA sessions with the speakers and opportunities for casual networking + pizzas and drinks. 

This group is co-founded by [Giovanni Brogiolo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-brogiolo-a3919627/){:target="_blank"} and [Hoss Zamani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoss-zamani-0aa28459/){:target="_blank"} in association with [Andres Rivera Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-rivera-gonzalez-b26650173/){:target="_blank"} and [Ven Natarajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatesh-natarajan-40a492b2/?originalSubdomain=au){:target="_blank"}.
