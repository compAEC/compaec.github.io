We are a group of people passionate about Computational Design in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. 

We're going to have two or three 20-minute presentations about computational methodologies for a better built environment. 

There will also be industry updates, one-on-one QA sessions with the speakers and opportunities for casual networking + pizzas and drinks. 

Reserve your tickets before they're gone. Spaces are limited.
